# UnrealSharp 

![CSharpCode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UnrealSharp/unrealsharp.github.io/main/media/home/CSharpExample.PNG)

UnrealSharp is a free and open-source plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that allows game developers to use C# in their projects with the power of .NET 8. It bridges the gap between C# and UE5, providing a seamless and efficient workflow for those who prefer C# over C++/Blueprints.
