# Get Started

## Prerequisites

Unreal Engine 5.3+ (UnrealSharp 0.2 was developed using 5.3, so may work on earlier versions)

Install [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

## Install UnrealSharp to your project

Clone this repo and place UnrealSharp in the **ProjectRootDirectory/Plugins** folder (make the Plugins folder if it doesn't exist) in your Unreal Engine project.

## Compiling UnrealSharp

Compile the plugin as any other Unreal Engine plugin using the IDE of your choice.

## Launching UnrealSharp

Start your project and everything will be setup for you.

Once Unreal Engine has fully opened, look in the directory **ProjectRootDirectory/Script** there will be a C# project now, it should look like this:

![ScriptFolder](https://github.com/UnrealSharp/UnrealSharp/assets/101010793/d55bc910-151f-4cf4-a72e-d696def6305c)

But instead of **ManagedCropoutUnrealSharp**, it should say **ManagedYourProjectName**. So don't get confused :D

## Start Scripting

Open the **ManagedYourProjectName.sln** file and create a C# class. 

Make a class like this:

```c#
using UnrealSharp.Attributes;
using UnrealSharp.Engine;

namespace ManagedCropoutUnrealSharp;

//Currently UClass attribute is a must for the editor to recognize the class
[UClass]
public class AMyTestClass : AActor
{
    //Optional constructor
    protected AMyTestClass()
    {
    }

    protected override void BeginPlay()
    {
        PrintString("Hello from C#!");
        base.BeginPlay();
    }

    [UProperty(PropertyFlags.BlueprintReadOnly)]
    public int MyInt { get; set; }
    
    [UProperty(PropertyFlags.BlueprintReadOnly)]
    public float MyFloat { get; set; }
    
    [UProperty(PropertyFlags.BlueprintReadOnly)]
    public string MyString { get; set; }

    [UProperty(DefaultComponent = true, RootComponent = true)]
    public UStaticMeshComponent MyRootMesh { get; set; }
    
    [UProperty(DefaultComponent = true)]
    public UStaticMeshComponent MyOtherMesh { get; set; }
    
    [UProperty(DefaultComponent = true, AttachmentComponent = nameof(MyRootMesh))]
    public UStaticMeshComponent MyMeshAttachedToRoot { get; set; }

    [UFunction(FunctionFlags.BlueprintCallable)]
    public void MyFunction(bool myBool, int MyInt)
    {
        PrintString("Hello from MyFunction!");
    }
}
```

Now go back to Unreal Engine and it should compile your code and your class should be able to be found in the editor.

## Debugging

Now you can close Unreal Engine, and start the project through the C# project by pressing F5, and you will attach a debugger to the Unreal Engine instance, and you can start debugging.

### Rider Steps 

If you're using Rider, you need to do an additional step to be able to debug.

Click on the run configurations up in the right corner:

![Debugging_01](https://github.com/UnrealSharp/UnrealSharp/assets/101010793/d235ead9-befd-4dab-9437-fd2d02edbcd6)

And then choose **.NET / .NET Core** on the **Runtime** setting.

![Debugging_02](https://github.com/UnrealSharp/UnrealSharp/assets/101010793/e6145fbe-826c-41e2-a1f4-6d4857eba73a)

Hit **Apply** and **OK**. Now you can press F5 and start scripting! ðŸ˜ƒ
